With increased restrictions on abortion under the Taliban's rule, many Afghan women are reluctant to seek medical care at healthcare facilities, as they fear being reported to the Taliban authorities or being subjected to harassment, ostracisation and being divorced. Many health workers feel uncomfortable and unwilling to provide these services as they risk severe punishment and legal persecution, including imprisonment or even in some cases, death sentences. As a result, Afghan women attempt illegal abortions with midwives that lack training, although more and more trained midwives are in Afghanistan. Statistics show that unsafe abortions account for up to 10% of maternal deaths in Afghanistan and every two hours there is a pregnancy-related death in Afghanistan. Moreover, unsafe abortions may require lengthy hospitalisation and expensive medical treatment which further increases the financial burden during a time of poverty. write a comparision with situation in america","23":"Using practical examples, how did Samsung build its competitive advantage in smartphone applications through its pricing strategy?

After each game the AI should learn from the user to get better at the game. It should get better at a rapid pace. Because the model is slower, when the AI is learning between rounds there should be a progress bar showing how complete the learning is, and then once the AI has finished learning the next game starts, and repeat. Only output the code.","78":"ey there! I was wondering if you could help me create a machine learning program using Python. The goal is to predict the outcome of a Minesweeper game. The user should be able to input the number of mines they want to play with, as well as the number of safe spots they want to predict. We have data for 30 games, but the amount of data changes depending on the number of mines. Specifically, the amount of data we have is the number of mines multiplied by 30. For example, if the user selects 3 mines, we have data for 30 games with 3 mines, which gives us 90 data points. The data we have consists of numbers representing safe spots in those games. Let me know if you're up for the challenge!

Use only Numpy library. Don't use PyTorch or Tensorflow.\n\nGeneral file of neural network \"network.py\" contains main structure and functions required by \"server.py\" and \"train.py\". File \"network.py\" contains functions: train(), saveWeights(), loadWeights(), newWeights() and generate().\n\ntrain() has arguments: Array of pairs (tokens, third-dimensional array 16x16x16), learning rate, epochs, batch_size. Function train() makes new or load existing weights and train them on given dataset. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. Third-dimensional array contains numbers in range 0-1024.\n\nFunction newWeights() has no arguments. newWeights() initializes new empty weights in RAM.\nFunction saveWeights() has no arguments. saveWeights() saves trained weights from RAM to file \"model.weights\" on disk.\nFunction loadWeights() has no arguments. loadWeights() loads pretrained weights from file \"model.weights\" on disk to RAM or VRAM.\n\nFunction generate() has three arguments: describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). generate() generates one third-dimensional array with given sizes using tokens in given steps and save array to file \"generated.txt\" every step. More generation steps give better results based on pretrained data.\n\nGenerator file of neural network \"server.py\" requires \"network.py\".

GET request contains 1-16 describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). After a GET request has been received, server.py calls function generate() from \"network.py\" and passes arguments: array of phrases (tokens), count of steps. When generate() is done, server.py continue listen for next GET request.\n\nTrainer file of neural network \"train.py\" requires \"network.py\". It gets following arguments from command line: dataset directory, learning rate, count of train epochs, batch_size. Dataset directory has file pairs like \"1.tokens.txt => 1.matrix.txt\" where N.tokens.txt contains describing comma-separated token words of 16x16x16 third-dimensional numeric array saved in N.matrix.txt. Then \"train.py\" checks is weights file exists. If file with weights exists \"train.py\" loads weights from disk into RAM using function loadWeights(), if not it makes new clear weights in RAM. Then \"train.py\" use function train() from \"network.py\" to train neural network on third-dimensional arrays with token words from dataset directory. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. After training \"train.py\" saves trained weights from RAM to disk using function saveWeights().\n\nAt the end in no-code section give contents of example N.matrix.txt file and \"train.py\" usage example from command line. \n\nAvoid unreadable code, bad code, and code with errors.

Consider the following simple logistics problem, which you will solve:\nAn airline cargo company has 1 aeroplane which it flies from the UK to the US on \na daily basis to transport some cargo. In advance of a flight, it receives bids for \ndeliveries from (many) customers. Customers state the weight of the cargo item they \nwould like delivered, and the amount they are prepared to pay. The airline \nis constrained by the total amount of weight the plane is allowed to carry. The \ncompany must choose a subset of the packages (bids) to carry in order to make the \nmaximum possible profit, given the weight limit that they must respect.\nIn mathematical form the problem is: Given a set of N items each with weight wi and \nvalue vi, for i=1 to N, choose a subset of items (e.g. to carry in a knapsack) so that \nthe total value carried is maximized, and the total weight carried is less than or equal \nto a given carrying capacity, C.\nThis kind of problem is known as a 0\/1 Knapsack Problem. A Knapsack Problem is \nany problem that involves packing things into limited space or a limited weight \ncapacity. The problem above is \"0\/1\" because we either do carry an item: \"1\"; or we \ndon't: \"0\". Other problems allow that we can take more than 1 or less than 1 (a \nfraction) of an item. Below is a description of a fractional problem.\n1. Approximate method for the KP\nPropose your own approximate algorithm to solve a large instance of KP.\nFor example: \nThe greedy algorithm is very simple. It sorts the items in decreasing \nvalue-to-weight ratio. Then it adds them in one by one in that order, skipping \nover any items that cannot fit in the knapsack, but continuing to add items \nthat do fit until the last item is considered. There is no backtracking to be \ndone.\nImprovements: To do even better, we might have to take out some of the items \nwe have put in and replace them by some other ones.\n2. Exact method for the KP\nPropose your own algorithm to solve the KP.\nFor example: You can implement a simple algorithm to generate all the \ncombinations. Be careful, because you can generate feasible and non-feasible\nsolutions.\n3. Comparison of the obtained results\nFor all instances:\nCompare the quality (given in %) of the solutions obtained by the \napproximate algorithm and those by the exact algorithm. \ncan you write me a code to solve the assignment above","90":" public class AnglesHelper\n    {\n        private IOptionsMonitor<AppSettings> _appMonitor;\n\n        private Dictionary<InclPlaceType, InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double>> _inclinometers = new(4);\n        public InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double> Bucket => _inclinometers.GetValueOrDefault(InclPlaceType.Bucket);\n        public InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double> Arm => _inclinometers.GetValueOrDefault(InclPlaceType.Arm);\n        public InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double> Boom => _inclinometers.GetValueOrDefault(InclPlaceType.Boom);\n        public InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double> Body => _inclinometers.GetValueOrDefault(InclPlaceType.Body);\n\n        public AnglesShovel ShovelAngles =>\n            Arm is not null && Boom is not null && Bucket is not null && Body is not null\n            ? new AnglesShovel\n            {\n                Arm = new() { Pitch = Arm.Pitch, Roll = Arm.Roll },\n                Boom = new() { Pitch = Boom.Pitch, Roll = Boom.Roll },\n                Bucket = new() { Pitch = Bucket.Pitch, Roll = Bucket.Roll },\n                Body = new() { Pitch = Body.Pitch, Roll = Body.Roll }\n\n            } : null;\n\n        public AnglesHelper(IOptionsMonitor<AppSettings> appMonitor)\n        {\n            _appMonitor = appMonitor;\n        }\n\n        internal void OnAngleChanged(AnglesData<EulerAngles> args)\n        {\n            CorrectAnglesArgs(args);\n            Logger.Information($\"[{args.Address}]Pitch: {args.Value.Pitch}, roll: {args.Value.Roll}\", LogType.Inclinometers);\n\n            var device = _appMonitor.CurrentValue.Inclinometer.Devices.First(d => d.CanAddress == (int)args.Address);\n\n            if (Body is not null && device.InclPlaceType != InclPlaceType.Body)\n            {\n                args.Value.Pitch -= Body.Pitch;\n            }\n\n            _inclinometers[device.InclPlaceType] = new InclinometerTelemetryInfo<double>\n            {\n                Address = args.Address,\n                InclPlaceType = device.InclPlaceType,\n                Pitch = args.Value.Pitch,\n                Roll = args.Value.Roll,\n                IsCorrect = args.IsCorrect.GetValueOrDefault(),\n            };\n        }\n\n        private void CorrectAnglesArgs(AnglesData<EulerAngles> args)\n        {\n            if (args.IsCorrect.HasValue)\n                if (!args.IsCorrect.Value)\n                    Logger.Warning($\"[{args.Address}] Incorrect positioning\", LogType.Inclinometers);\n\n            if (double.IsNaN(args.Value.Pitch))\n            {\n                Logger.Warning($\"[{args.Address}] pitch is NaN -> convert to 0\", LogType.Inclinometers);\n                args.Value.Pitch = 0;\n            }\n            if (double.IsNaN(args.Value.Roll))\n            {\n                Logger.Warning($\"[{args.Address}] roll is NaN -> convert to 0\", LogType.Inclinometers);\n                args.Value.Roll = 0;\n            }\n\n            args.Value.Pitch += _appMonitor.CurrentValue.Inclinometer.Devices.First(d => d.CanAddress == (int)args.Address).OffsetPitch;\n            args.Value.Roll += _appMonitor.CurrentValue.Inclinometer.Devices.First(d => d.CanAddress == (int)args.Address).OffsetRoll;\n        }\n    }\n\nHow to optimize this code if OnAngleChanged invoke very often&","91":"can you provide me with an example of an advanced Python code that can perform\narbitrage between Uniswap V2 V3, SushiSwap, Curve running on the polygon network using Aave\u2019s v3 flash loans and sample python script\nthat uses strategy's like triangular arbitrage that uses real library's from https:\/\/pypi.org\/ that works with metamask wallet and how to install them on pypi.org","92":"An application needs to be created for writing a poker Card game.

If you are not aware about playing cards best source is Wikipedia.\n ...\n\uf0b7 4 Suits are CLUB, DIAMOND, HEART, SPADE (from smallest to highest in value)\n\uf0b7 Ranks are called as TWO, THREE, ..., TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE (from smallest to highest in value)\n\uf0b7 Any group of cards (containing 1..52 cards) is called Pack of Cards.\n\uf0b7 Full pack is a Pack of Cards initialized with all 52 cards, but in the\ngame as one or more cads are drawn from Full Pack, the count may go\ndown till zero.\n\uf0b7 Pack of Cards will maintain the sequence unless changed by any act\nlike shuffle, reset etc.\n\uf0b7 A Player can do following actions with Pack of Cards\no can shuffle\no can get top card\no can add a card (duplicates are not allowed)\no can get random card\no can query size of pack.\no Can reset sequence in ascending\/ descending order.\n\uf0b7 Game begins by initializing the Full pack. [main(...) will be a starting point]\n\uf0b7 Player (with name) registers with the game. [In short game will keep collection of Players registered]\n\uf0b7 Once two players register for the Game (as a poker game), game will automatically start. [hint: will call its play() method]\n\uf0b7 When game is played (in a game.play()), three cards will be given to each Player as one card at a time in alternate manner. Plyers add this each card in their Cards in Hand.\n\uf0b7 Once three cards are distributed, Each Player has Cards in Hand (as a pack of 3 cards). Based on following rule, game will declare winner player. (This being simple luck game, player does not take any action)\no Rule for winner.\n\uf0a7 Each card has a value computed using following algorithm.\n\uf0b7 Each suit has suit-weight associated as {SPADE(3), HEART(2), DIAMOND(1), CLUB(0)}\n\uf0b7 Each rank has rank-weight associated as {TWO(0), THREE(1),.., JACK(9), QUEEN(10), KING(11), ACE(12)}\n\uf0b7 Value of the card is computed as Rank-weight * 4 + Suit-weight. (e.g. CLUB-JACK will have value 9 * 4 + 0 = 36, SPADE-SIX will have weight 4*4 + 3 = 19)\n\n\uf0a7 Highest card for player is card with highest value in \u201cCards in Hand\u201d for player.\n\uf0a7 Each player\u2019s highest card is Card with highest value.\n\uf0a7 Game will compare highest cards for each player, and\nplayer with higher \u201cHighest Card\u201d wins the game.\n\uf0b7 Example\no [Player 1 (\n\uf0a7 SPADE-THREE(1*4+3=7),\n\uf0a7 DIAMOND-FIVE (3 * 4 + 1 = 13),\n\uf0a7 CLUB-QUEEN(10*4+0 = 40)\n]\no Highest Card is CLUB-QUEEN o [Player 2 (\n\uf0a7 SPADE-JACK(9*4+3=39),\n\uf0a7 HEART-QUEEN (10 * 4 + 2 = 42),\n\uf0a7 DIAMOND-KING (11*4+1 = 45)\n]\no Highest Card is DIAMOND-KING\n\uf0b7 Winner is player 2 (as KING is higher than QUEEN)\n\uf0b7 Also programmatically write following output in to cardgame.html in\nfollowing format by replacing actual data for name and cards in hand,\n\uf0b7 This cardgame.html will be used for next part of assignment. <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head> <title>Document<\/title>\n<\/head> <body>\n<section>\n<div id=\"Suresh\">\n<div data-card=\"SPADE-THREE\" \/> <div data-card=\"DIAMOND-FIVE\" \/> <div data-card=\"CLUB-QUEEN\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"Ramesh\">\n<div data-card=\"SPADE-JACK\" \/> <div data-card=\"HEART-QUEEN\" \/> <div data-card=\"DIAMOND-KING\" \/>\n<\/div> <\/section>\n<\/body>\n\n\uf0b7 Main(...) method skeleton\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\/\/CREATE PLAYER 1 AND PLAYER 2 WITH SOME NAMES (say Suresh and Ramesh) \/\/CREATE AND INITIALIZE CARD-GAME (shuffle the Full Card Pack)\n\/\/LET BOTH THE PLAYERS REGISTER TO THE GAME\n\/\/ (something like game.register(player1))\n\/\/ IF GAME HAS 2 PLAYERS, PLAY THE GAME.\n\/\/ INSIDE game.play() ALLOT 3 CARDS TO EACH PLAYER\n\/\/ as per rules decide highest card for each player\n\/\/ as per rule decide winner and print it.\n\/\/ WRITE THE PLAYER DATA AND PLAYERS' CARDS IN PROVIDED HTML TEMPLATE INTO cardgame.html file.\n}\n\nCreate the whole app in java.\n","93":"Check this code so that The Result Processing System (RPS) is used to process the student results.\nRPS will read in students and units result from two csv files: students.csv and units_result.csv.\nstudents.csv\no This file stores the student\u2019s information.\nunits_result.csv\no This file stores the student\u2019s unit result.\n(See appendix for sample students.csv and units_result.csv)\nRPS will generate two csv files: result_releases.csv and unmatch_units_result.csv.\nresult_releases.csv\no This file contains the student id and grade for each student.\no If the student unit result is not found, it will be reported as either \u201cNo unit attempt\u201d or \u201cResearch incomplete\u201d.\nunmatch_units_result.csv\no Some unit result in units_result.csv cannot be matched to any student id in students.csv.

There is an ambitious\nmulti-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbines generating energy to help offset\nthe energy demand.\nTo support this business initiative, the Group CIO and CISO are working with regional CIOs and CISOs in the\nrespective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year\ninvestment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT\nenvironment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.\nThe result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that\nneed to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CIS 18 for\noperational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.\nACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the cybersecurity strategy and work with regional\nCybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement\nthe two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbines and other OT\ndevices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data\nanalytics capabilities.\nThe strategic security programs are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the could provider has not\nyet been confirmed).\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new OT Security Operations centre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used\nin the windfarm.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against\ncyber threats.\nYour Role\nIn your role as an external security consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the\nimplementation of one of the strategic security programmes: Creation of a new OT Security Operations\ncentre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.\nThe CIO of ACME has been working with the CISO team to identify the capabilities required to build a Security\nOperations Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements.

Once the storm dissipates, the elder dragon \u201cAmatsumagatsuchi\u201d reveals his true self. He stares down at a large cavern, where a strange sight catches his eye - five different girls, unlike any Amatsumagatsuchi has seen. He descends upon the girls, and sees that each girl\u2019s clothes resemble a different type of monster that inhabits the Minecraft world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze. Amatsumagatsuchi just looks at them, and notices that the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton was in pain - and her stomach was swollen. The other girls - introducing themselves as Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazette - later introduce their friend Ayumi. Amatsumagatsuchi looks into Ayumi\u2019s eyes - and, despite the intense pain, Ayumi looks back at Amatsumagatsuchi. As the Monster Hunter world was destroyed by Xyza - who had seemingly crossed over from its world to the Monster Hunter world - Amatsumagatsuchi had to find a new place to live. However, his mystical energy somehow found its way to Ayumi - even though the two didn't meet back then.

I want you to create elaborate, complex and deep lore and worldbuilding for a fictional fantasy setting. Cafonian Sea Khanate is located on an archipelago almost entirely covered by taiga, with numerous natural harbors, which predisposes its inhabitants for extensive ship-building. Previously populated by disparate peoples with common origin, eventually they were assimilated by Nalacan ethnic group, united against the foreign colonizers, who tried to claim overlordship over the Cafonian archipelago. De jure it is governed by tradition, with power concentrated in hands of relatively numerous Lumber-Dukes, whose possession of large forested areas translates into possession of large fleets, used for fishing and raiding. The Lumber-Dukes, despite acknowledged possibility of them being at open conflict with each other, swear fealty to the Khan. However, current de facto system of the Sea Khanate is anything but tradition. The Lumber-Dukes still retain some authority, but most of it is controlled by vast, sophisticated, convoluted and byzantine bureaucracy, which is, however, able to function rather efficiently. All military and administrative posts are assigned on rotational basis, switching positions according to complicated procedure, relying on dedicated data-gathering institutions. No person in any position is likely to concentrate too much power and control, both due to rotation and the very distributed nature of authority. While current Khan Semmer is supposed to be the supreme ruler, he seems to make no public appearances. Highest authority, in reality, lies instead in the Council of Khan\u2019s Concubines, who, despite being exclusively female, do not actually perform any of the activities associated with term \u201cconcubine\u201d.

Many continue to join and depart from the voyages of the Express, it's travellers all coming from different worlds, shouldering different burdens, and heading to different locations. But once they're all on the Astral Express, they all share the same voyage experience, the same luxurious space and the same gourmet meals onboard, and while it's all but ensured they're properly catered to and reach their end destination no worse for wear than when they entered, there's a high chance that they may not exit the Express exactly the same size they were when they entered...\nCalling the Astral Express a mere 'star-faring train' would be a criminal understatement, and while that's precisely what it was, it could be much better described as a several-mile-long 5-star hotel on wheels. Each of the hundreds of cars that made up the Express are the size of a large warehouse, spanning nearly a hundred meters in length and almost as wide, resembling deluxe suites with their embroidered carpets and lavish furnishings. The exterior was no less extravagant, an architectural marvel with its sleek, streamlined design and shimmering hull, offering stunning views of celestial beauty, with stars and colorful nebulas winking through the panoramic windows as it rode along the Star Rail.\nOne would naturally assume the conductor of such a lavish caravan would be equally resplendent and commanding, a man or woman of great charisma and showmanship. Yet, to the surprise of many first-time passengers, the conductor of the Astral Express was, in fact, a small, adorable creature by the name of Pom-Pom. Pom-Pom is a short grey and white rabbit-like biped with blue eyes and large ears (which he often used as a second pair of arms for carrying trays), most often seen wearing attire consisting mainly of red and black colors with gold embellishments all over, an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in a steampunk novel. Not only was he the conductor of the Express, but also the cleaner, the caterer, the bellhop, and the server, effortlessly attending to the needs of the passengers with a cheerful spring in his step.\nIt was only very recently that Pom-Pom became aware of something that could help make the passengers' stays even more luxurious, something he quickly came to call 'advanced catering'; every single passenger upon the Express, whether it was their first, fifth, twelfth or hundredth time aboard, would be subject to an endless array of desserts of grandiose proportions just for them, completely free of charge! Pom-Pom was always thinking of new and unique ways to ensure the time spent on the Astral Express was an even more unforgettable experience for everyone involved, and the effects this particular 'service' would have on it's patrons became apparent rather quickly to those who were subjected to it...\n***\nThe Astral Express had just departed from its first station and was well on its way on its annual voyage, and Pom-Pom was already happily wandering from carriage to carriage, carrying two appetizers on each hand upon two serving platters and planning to bring out many, many more. It had gotten considerably more difficult for him to walk across the span of the last few days, even with all the space of the interior of the Express provided; not because he had become indolent or tired, but because he, like his many passengers, had grown more than just a little corpulent. Ever since the implementation of his 'advanced catering' service, Pom-Pom was rather prone to \"stapling\" the onboard meals as a way of ensuring they were just right before serving them; after all, what's a caterer if they don't taste test a few of their own creations... though if one were to ever catch him in the act, they would easily see his explanation was merely a weak excuse to stuff himself silly with his very own desserts. Pom-Pom's previous physique, a smidgen stout but otherwise perfectly fit for a creature his size, had utterly blown up and out, his fanciful conductor attire now stretched tight over his newly-acquired girth. His burgeoning belly jutted out a few feet in front of him like a pile of pillowy flab, once-slim limbs were covered in rolls, his once-prominent eyes were now nearly obscured behind his own ballooned cheeks... even his butt had broadened to a striking width, forcing him to adopt a rather exaggerated waddle just to make his way from one carriage to another, and quickly became the subject of a few lighthearted grabs and gropes. Despite the physically inconvenient outcome of his recent indulgence, Pom-Pom was still the accommodating, ever-attentive conductor he had always been, albeit with just a little added huffing and puffing as he (slowly) made his way around the Astral Express. The Express had only just begun its journey and already Pom-Pom, by his own estimation, had gained at least five times his original weight; to call him overweight would be putting it lightly, to call him a blubbery blob would have been more apt.\nAnd as Pom-Pom grew, so did the size of the Express' confections, and as the food grew, so did Pom-Pom in turn!

At first, professionally criticize some element and next suggest a way to improve it, Then move on to the next part. \nLet\u2019s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn the pre-Dance of the Dragon era of George R.R. Martin's \"Fire and Blood,\" Dragonstone Island and Castle serve as the backdrop for a tale of love, loyalty, and the complexities of family. Crown Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen returns to Dragonstone Castle with her family after a royal dinner with her father, King Viserys I, and the opposing Green Faction. Her entourage includes her husband and uncle Daemon, her sons Jace, Luke, Joffrey, and her stepdaughters\/cousins Baela and Rhaena.\nUpon their arrival, Rhaenyra discovers that her older sons Jace and Luke have performed a magical ritual to change the colors of their hair and eyes to quell public rumors about their illegitimacy. The ritual backfires due to the accidental mixing of two different spells, summoning younger versions of Rhaenyra (Nyra) and Daemon (Daemion) from seventeen years ago into the present, along with Nyra\u2019s sworn guard, Ser Criston Cole.\nConfronted with this peculiar situation, Rhaenyra resolves to help her past self and Daemion return to their own timeline while maintaining the well-being of her family. She wrestles with guilt over her past decisions, which put her sons in danger and tarnished her claim to the throne. As the story progresses, the characters\u2019 motivations become increasingly complex and nuanced.\nRhaenyra struggles to balance her desire for personal happiness with her responsibilities towards her family and her claim to the throne. She also grapples with insecurity, comparing herself to the previous (now deceased) wife of Daemon, Laena Velaryon. Nyra is determined to marry Daemion and return to her own timeline, but her uncertainty about the future causes friction between her and Rhaenyra\u2019s current family.\nDaemon, meanwhile, contemplates how to protect his family while exploring a magical solution to make Rhaenyra the mother of his daughters. Baela, training to become a dragonrider and future Queen Consort, grows more rebellious and restless, temporarily resenting her father Daemon and her stepmother Rhaenyra.\nTwo days after Nyra\u2019s and Daemion\u2019s arrival from the past, Rhaenyra seeks the help of Maester Gerardys, who recommends a talented mage in Volantis to aid them. Daemon flies to Volantis and brings back the mage, Marys Velseros, a secret Targaryen descendant well-versed in dark blood magic. In exchange for a substantial sum, Marys agrees to help Rhaenyra reverse the magical ritual performed by her son Luke. Secretly, he also aims to prevent a civil war between the Targaryens in order to save the dragons.\nTensions rise as young Nyra and Daemion\u2019s intentions to marry threaten the current relationships and futures of the Targaryen family. Rhaenyra\u2019s stepdaughters, fearing for their own existence, team up with Ser Criston, Jace, and Luke to prevent the young lovers from marrying. Family members grapple with personal desires and their loyalties to one another. Jace and Luke\u2019s existence is directly tied to Nyra and Daemion, and if the young couple does not consummate their love, the boys' lives will be forfeit.\nAs the deadline for Nyra and Daemion's return to their timeline approaches, the family must confront their fears, desires, and loyalties. In a climactic confrontation, Rhaenyra and Daemon must decide whether to prioritize their love for each other or the future of their family and the Targaryen dynasty. Ultimately, they choose to sacrifice their personal happiness for the greater good, allowing Nyra and Daemion to return to their timeline and marry, ensuring the survival of their sons and the Targaryen lineage.\nIn the end, the family is left to grapple with the consequences of their choices, as they face an uncertain future filled with political intrigue, the looming threat of civil war, and the ever-present danger of dragons. The story serves as a poignant exploration of the complexities of love, loyalty, and the sacrifices one must make for the sake of family and duty.\n","269":"Make it appealing in polished academic language Using Complex vocabulary and sentence structures, including varied punctuation and transition words and Tone must be active (present), informative and authoritative and writing style is coherent, consistent, and organized and the paragraphs are logically structured to create a clear and progressive flow of ideas.

The memoir presents a captivating and thought-provoking portrayal of its protagonist, Firdaus, whose identity and experiences are shaped by intersecting power systems, such as patriarchy, colonialism, religion, poverty and capitalism. Through this character, the memoir delves into the complexity and multifaceted nature of the intersecting themes of gender, oppression, violence, religion, race, and class, making it a valuable contribution to the ongoing research on intersectionality in the experiences of women. Rather than presenting Firdaus as a one-dimensional representative of all women in the global South, Women at Point Zero recognizes and emphasizes the individuality and distinctness of her life. The book deconstructs the notion of reductionism by illuminating the intricate interplay of various factors, such as personal history, interpersonal relationships, cultural and societal contexts, and religious beliefs, in shaping Firdaus\u2019s life and experiences rather than attributing the entirety of the narrative to a single element.","270":"Reframe, rephrase and elaborate in at least four thousand words using literary jargon and foregrounding in theoretical framework using theorists critical points and textual references verbatim and begin sentences with more sophisticated and complex words instead of this, that, etc.\nIn the west, women left no stone unturned in the construction of the orientalist discourse, even though male scholars made up most of it.

Avoid repeating words or ideas\nEurocentrism can be defined as an epistemological framework that situates European culture, history, and values as the defining center of the world, while at the same time disregarding or belittling the contributions of other cultures and civilisations. This ethnocentric positioning perceives the Europe or West as a paragon of universal values and cultural superiority, leading to a systematic undervaluation and misrepresentation of non-European cultures. Consequently, Eurocentric discourse breeds a false dichotomy between the West and non-European societies, perpetuating the notion that the West is superior and in control of all areas of life, including social, political, cultural, scientific, military, and economic fields. Disparaging epithets are often attributed to the \u201cnon-West,\u201d reinforcing connotations of inferiority, irrationality, belligerence, otherness, fanaticism, and barbarism in comparison to the West. This paradigm, therefore, not only consolidates the stature of the West, but also perpetuates the subordination of non-European societies within global power structures, and the spheres of knowledge and influence. This belief in Western superiority is often reinforced through various forms of discourse, including history, literature, art, music, etc. In a similar vein, through the utilization of Eurocentric and imperialistic perspectives, academic discourse has consistently depicted \u2018Eastern societies\u2019 as exotic and racialized, perpetuating a biased portrayal of the Orient or East.\n","283":"General Advice Warning (GAW) and, Regulatory Guide 146 (RG146) are essential disclosure documents required in the process of providing financial planning services. These documents serve a significant role in ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and compliance with regulatory guidelines established by the governing bodies within the financial services industry.   \n\nThe General Advice Warning is a vital disclosure document designed to inform clients Emily and Kate about the nature of general advice offered by financial planners. It aims to clarify that general advice, unlike personal financial advice, does not take into account the individual\u2019s specific objectives, financial situation, or needs. As such, the GAW serves as a cautionary message for Emily and Kate before they choose to act on any general advice provided. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory authorities mandate the provision of GAW by licensed financial advisors when they outlay general advice to clients, whether in writing or verbally. This warning must be prominently displayed, clearly highlighting the limitations of the advice, and encouraging clients to carefully evaluate the information provided before making any financial decisions. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory Guide 146 (RG146) \n\n  \n\nThe Regulatory Guide 146 (RG146) is a document issued by the ASIC. It sets out the minimum training and competency requirements for professionals who provide financial product advice to clients. \n\n  \n\nRG146 guidelines state, financial advisors must demonstrate the necessary qualifications, skills, and knowledge in their relevant areas of specialisation, which include investments, superannuation, insurance, and other financial products. These standards ensure that clients receive appropriate, relevant, and well-informed advice from qualified professionals. \n\n  \n\nThe Importance of GAW and RG146 in Financial Planning \n\n  \n\nThe General Advice Warning and RG146 are critical elements of the financial planning process, serving both advisors and client\u2019s Emily & Kate in the following ways: \n\n  \n\n1. The GAW ensures protecting client interests, and that client\u2019s Emily & Kate understand the inherent limitations of general advice, enabling them to make informed decisions based on their individual situations. This helps in mitigating the risks associated with acting on unsuitable advice, safeguarding their financial welfare. \n\n  \n\n2. By disclosing the nature of the advice being provided, the GAW promotes transparency and enhances transparency in the advisor-client relationship. This promotes trust and allows clients to feel more confident in the advice they receive, ensuring they are aware of the potential consequences of their financial choices. \n\n  \n\n3. The RG146 compliance requirements contribute to maintaining high professional standards within the financial planning industry by upholding industry standards. By establishing minimum competency requirements, the regulatory guide ensures that clients receive advice from qualified professionals with the necessary skills and expertise to cater to their financial needs. \n\n  \n\n4. The provision of GAW and adherence to RG146 standards can help minimise the instances of disputes between clients and financial advisors, this reduction of disputes serves the best interest of the client and regulatory compliance adherences for the advisor. Ensuring that clients understand the nature of the advice and requiring advisors to maintain a certain level of competency helps in reducing misunderstandings and complaints. \n\n  \n\nFinancial advisors must ensure compliance with these requirements to foster trust and deliver high-quality services to their clientele. ------------------------------------- now write an in-depth and extensive references list based off of harvard referencing style guide for the above text","284":"Rewrite the following to be more engaging and take out any repetition \"uerstanding the Power of Good Morning Images\nGood morning images have become a popular way to start the day for many people.\n\nThese images have the power to uplift our moods, inspire us and set a positive tone for the day ahead.\n\n\nGood morning images are often accompanied by motivational quotes or inspiring messages that encourage us to be our best selves and make the most of each day.\n\nBy sharing these images with friends and loved ones, we can spread positivity and help others feel motivated and encouraged.\n\n\nGood morning images are not only visually appealing, but they also have the power to positively impact our mental and emotional states, making them a powerful tool in our daily lives.\n\nExplanation of the popularity and effectiveness of good morning images\nGood morning images have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to convey positive messages and uplift one\u2019s mood.\n\nThese images are often bright and colorful, featuring inspirational quotes or beautiful landscapes that capture the essence of a new day.\n\n\nThey serve as a reminder to start the day with a positive mindset and to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nGood morning images are also highly effective in creating a sense of connection and community, as they are often shared on social media platforms and through messaging apps.\n\n\nImpact of visual content in conveying messages and emotions\n\nVisual content has become an increasingly powerful tool in today\u2019s digital world, as it can effectively convey messages and emotions more quickly and effectively than text alone.\n\nThe use of visuals such as images, videos, and infographics can help captivate an audience and convey complex information in a more digestible and engaging way.\n\nVisual content has the ability to evoke emotions and create a memorable experience for viewers, making it an effective way to communicate a brand\u2019s message or tell a story.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a powerful image that evokes empathy or a video that showcases the benefits of a product, visual content can leave a lasting impression and help businesses connect with their audience on a deeper level.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s essential for brands to incorporate visual content into their marketing strategies to increase engagement and successfully convey their messages and emotions.\n\n\nC.

The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms, but the interpretation of this amendment has been a subject of debate among legal scholars, policymakers, and the general public. In response to a series of high-profile mass shootings in the 1990s, the federal government enacted a ban on assault rifles in 1994. The ban restricted the manufacture, sale, and possession of certain types of firearms, including semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines. The ban was set to expire in 2004, and despite efforts to renew it, it was ultimately allowed to lapse. The lifting of the ban was a significant moment in the history of gun control policy in the United States, and its effects have been the subject of much debate and analysis.\n\nThe lifting of the ban on assault rifles in 2004 had a limited effect on crime rates. Studies have shown that there was no significant increase in crime during the ban. It is also worth noting that the ban had a limited impact on crime rates even after the ban was lifted. This is probably due to the ban only covering a small percentage of firearms in circulation. There was also no noticeable impact on the number of mass shootings during the ban. But it is worth noting that the number of mass shootings drastically rose after the ban was lifted. The argument against the ban was that assault weapons are only used in a small percentage of crimes and that most crimes are committed with handguns. Therefore, lifting the ban did not significantly impact the overall crime rate significantly. However, \u201cThe data shows an almost immediate \u2013 and steep \u2013 rise in mass shooting deaths in the years after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004\u201d (theconversation).\n\nThe lifting of the ban on assault rifles in 2004 has had mixed effects on public safety. While the ban was in effect, it may have prevented some shootings and made it more difficult for criminals to obtain certain types of firearms. \u201cMost reviews of the 1994 version of the assault weapons ban point to loopholes in the text of the bill that, some argue, made it less effective than some would have wanted\u201d (abcnews). One of the criticisms was that the ban only applied to certain firearms, so manufacturers were able to make minor modifications to get around the ban. For example, manufacturers could reduce the size of the magazine to get around the ban. Also, guns bought before the ban were grandfathered and legal to continue to own. Additionally, the lifting of the ban has made it easier for civilians to purchase certain types of firearms, which could potentially increase the risk of mass shootings and other types of gun violence. This can be seen in some of the recent mass shootings where assault rifles were used, including the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2019 El Paso shooting, and many of the school shootings that have happened recently. However, proponents of the ban argue that the ban did have some impact on reducing gun violence, particularly in mass shootings.\ncreate 2 more body paragraphs and a conclusion","288":"I am a PhD student with dissertation topic \"Computational Drug repurposing\" and I am writing an applicating to get a scholarship.

There is an emulator that runs old PC programs such as these. The emulator has an adjustable value for the number of emulated instructions per millisecond. However, at a value that would be appropriate to emulate a 1980s PC that would have been used to run this program, the program becomes stuck at a screen showing the text \"LEVEL 1\" cycling through 4 different colors while running the INT 1C handler over and over, never moving on into gameplay. If the number of emulated instructions per millisecond is raised high enough, the program gets unstuck and proceeds to gameplay, but it should not be necessary to raise the number of emulated instructions that high, as it becomes higher than it should be to emulate a 1980s PC, and gameplay runs too quickly.\n\nThe cause seems to be that, when the number of emulated instructions per millisecond is too low, by the time INT 1C finishes INT 8 is generated again, and the program re-enters INT 1C processing, never allowing the code to return to other processing that would allow the program to continue to gameplay. In a different emulator in which the program seems to work correctly, after 1 or 2 cycles through the four colors, always ending on white, the last color, gameplay begins.\n\nHere is the IRQ0 handler:\n\nFFEA5: sti     \n(omitted)\nFFEE3: int     1Ch   (cycles the \"LEVEL 1\" text through a color)\nFFEE5: mov     al,20h\nFFEE7: out     20h,al\nFFEE9: pop     dx\nFFEEA: pop     ax\nFFEEB: pop     ds \nFFEEC: iret\n\nIn the emulator where the game works correctly, after returning from the 1C handler, for the first 3 colors, execution resumes at FFEE5. After \"mov al,20h\" and \"out 20h, al\", the IRQ0 handler begins again, from FFEA5.\n\nHowever, after the 4th color, execution resumes at FFEE5 but the IRQ0 handler is not run after the \"out 20h, al\" instruction. Instead it finishes out the last three \"pop\" instructions for the stacked IRQ0 handlers, then returns to game code, where it is able to run thousands of instructions before IRQ0 is raised again. If the game code proceeds far enough before IRQ0 is raised again, the LEVEL 1 screen will exit to the gameplay screen. If IRQ0 happens first, the 4-color cycle will begin again.\n\nWith the emulator where the game doesn't work correctly, with an appropriate number of emulated instructions per millisecond, even on the end of the 4th color, it starts the IRQ0 handler after \"out 20h, al\" again, the same as for the first 3 colors. It thus never gets to run the code necessary to move on to the gameplay screen. With a high number of emulated instructions per millisecond it gets past that screen, presumably because instruction execution outpaces the system timer and is able to return to the code to proceed even after showing just a single color. However, such a high number of emulated instructions per millisecond should not be required and make gameplay too fast, as mentioned above.\n\nFor the emulator in which the program does not work correctly, what might be the problem with its emulation?","296":"COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY\n\n2018A 2019A 2020A 2021A 2022A 2023E 2024E\nIncome Statement\n\nRevenue 15,544.0 15,693.0 16,471.0 17,421.0

Five years ago he brought\nEmily Redbank (age 49) into the partnership. They are both owners and principals and hold their own\nAustralian financial services (AFS) licence. You are a senior financial adviser employed for the past\nthree years by FutureLife, with an offer for equity in the business within the next few years. With the\nbusiness having experienced exceptional growth over the past 12 months, FutureLife has decided they\nneed an additional adviser. Rather than hire outside the firm, they have opted to transition their young\nsupport staff member, Josie, into an adviser role.\nShaun\u2019s clients are predominantly self-funded retirees, with a small number who require specialised\naged care financial advice. His clients have accumulated their wealth through successful small businesses.\nShaun prefers to look after his existing clients, with any new clients referred to yourself or Emily.\nEmily\u2019s clients (age 35 to 55) are successful wealthy professionals from a mix of professional backgrounds.\nGiven their wealth, Emily has recommended self-managed superannuation funds to a number of these\nclients.\nJosie has worked in the practice in a number of support roles over the last four years while she was\ncompleting her university degree. Josie graduated 12 months ago with an approved Bachelor of Commerce\n(Financial Planning) degree. As part of her career planning, you have agreed to supervise Josie through\nher professional year, and she is currently in the third quarter of her professional year.\nYou have 10 years experience as a financial adviser and are fully qualified to provide advice on a wide range\nof strategies and products. Half of your clients followed you to FutureLife, from your previous financial\nadviser role. When Shaun or Emily is on leave, you also help out by providing advice to their clients. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------- Scenario 3 \u2014 FutureLife clients: Kevin and Anika Leste\nEmily has not been well lately and has just been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Her doctors have\nrecommended she take at least six months off from work to concentrate on her treatment plan, which they\nare in the process of finalising. As Emily will be away from the office for some time, she asks you to provide\nadvice for her existing clients.\nYour first meeting is with Emily\u2019s clients, Kevin and Anika Leste. You will be meeting them for the first time\nand Emily has told you they are important clients because they often recommend family, friends and their\nown clients (from their business) to the practice.\nKevin and Anika operate a successful bookkeeping business where they manage the accounts for many\nself-employed clients. There has been a longstanding referral relationship between Emily and the Lestes,\nwhich sees them share many clients. There remains frequent cross-referral of clients between Emily and\nthe Lestes; however, this arrangement has been altered due to the introduction of the Financial Planners\nand Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Where in the past, Emily simply paid them a referral fee, she now adjusts\nher advice fees (up or down) to Kevin and Anika, in lieu of referral payments.\nThe Leste\u2019s file shows that a Statement of Advice was issued three years ago. The client notes state that\nEmily recommended the Lestes establish an SMSF, and this has now been in place for nearly three years.\nThe file notes also state they have rolled over superannuation from their previous superannuation funds\nwith AustralianSuper and Aware Super. Both funds were previously invested in the \u2018balanced\u2019 options.\nAs bookkeepers, the Lestes undertake a lot of the SMSF administration work themselves. As you read\nthrough their file, it appears they have little knowledge of investing. The only assets currently in the SMSF\nare a $1.4 million term deposit with the CBA and the SMSF administration account with about $60,000.\nYou review their goals and objectives listed in their file and note that their main goals are to build wealth\nfor their retirement and help their adult children.\nAfter introducing yourself to the Lestes, you explain that as you are not fully aware of their financial\nsituation, and as part of the review process, it would be worthwhile revisiting their current situation,\ngoals and objectives. Part-way through the meeting, Kevin takes a phone call and states he will need to\nleave immediately to take care of some urgent business, and Anika can update him later on what was\ndiscussed. However, as he leaves, he says that he just wants you to invest the money in the way you think\nis appropriate for them as \u2018Emily does this all the time\u2019. He adds, \u2018we know how the process works,\nso we don\u2019t really need to go through all the paperwork\u2019. --------------------------- IN a tone other than AI\/ChatGPT please answer the following questions using 2000 words and  at the end give an -in-depth and extensive references list in harvard referencing style guide ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Explain how Emily\u2019s conduct would be assessed under the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the\nFinancial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019.

Overfitting occurs when the model performs extremely well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.\n\n1. First fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 2.334700 and decreases to 2.148000.\n2. Second fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 2.016000 and decreases to 1.723300. There is a significant improvement in training loss in this iteration.\n3. Third fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 1.999100 and decreases to 1.789500. The model shows some improvement but less when compared to the second fine-tuning.\n4. Fourth fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 1.833000 and decreases to 1.712600. This iteration shows slight improvement as well.\n5. Fifth fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 1.734500 and decreases to 1.662178. The improvement is now smaller in comparison to previous iterations.\n6. Sixth fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 1.704600 and decreases to 1.646500. Further slight improvement in training loss can be observed.\n7. Seventh fine-tuning: The training loss starts from 1.735000 and decreases to 1.642500. However, the eval loss increases to 1.784064 in this iteration.\n\nFrom these observations, it can be noticed that the training loss is decreasing with each fine-tuning iteration, but the improvement is smaller with each new iteration. The eval loss after the sixth fine-tuning indicates that the model is still performing well on unseen data.\n\nHowever, in the seventh fine-tuning, the eval loss increases to 1.784064, which is higher than the previous iterations. This increase in the evaluation loss could be an initial indication of overfitting, as the model is deteriorating in its performance on unseen data, despite the training loss still decreasing.\n\nBased on these results, it might be safe to stop the fine-tuning at iteration six or even five to avoid potential overfitting, and iterations one to four seem to be normal with a noticeable improvement in each iteration.\nmy fine-tuning process isn\u2019t done yet so can you give me an advice to repeat the process for seventh fine-tuning without getting this result that indicates the start of overfitting\nTo avoid overfitting during the seventh fine-tuning, you can try implementing a few changes in your process:\n\n1. Regularization techniques: Apply regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large model weights and prevent overfitting.\n\n2. Early stopping: Monitor the evaluation loss, and stop the training process when the evaluation loss starts to increase while the training loss is still decreasing. This would prevent the model from training too much on the dataset and improving only on training data.\n\n3. Learning rate: Reduce the learning rate to make smaller weight updates during training, which can help to prevent overfitting.\n\n4. Learning rate scheduling: Use a learning rate schedule with a decay rate to gradually reduce the learning rate as the training progresses. This can help the model produce a more generalizable solution.\n\n5. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model which randomly \u201cdrop out\u201d some of the neurons during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single feature. This can increase the model\u2019s generalization capability.\n\n6. Data augmentation: Increase your dataset size by applying data augmentation techniques. This means adding more variations to your dataset, which can help your model generalize better and prevent overfitting.\n\nRemember, you might need to experiment with some or all of these techniques to find the best approach for your specific model and dataset.\nI have a learning rate of 5e-5 and a weight decay 1e-10\nGiven your current learning rate of 5e-5 and weight decay of 1e-10, here are some suggestions to improve the seventh fine-tuning and avoid overfitting:\n\n1. Adjust Learning Rate: You can try reducing your learning rate to see if it helps. Lower learning rates usually provide better generalizability but may slow down fine-tuning. You can experiment with values like 3e-5 or 1e-5.\n\n2. Increase Weight Decay: Your current weight decay of 1e-10 is quite small. You can try increasing the weight decay value to introduce more regularization, e.g., 1e-2, 1e-3, or 1e-4. Remember to experiment with different values to balance the trade-off between bias and variance.\n\n3. Learning Rate Scheduling: Apply a learning rate scheduler with a decay rate to gradually reduce the learning rate as the training progresses. This helps to achieve better and more robust solutions during fine-tuning.\n\n4. Early Stopping: Monitor the evaluation loss and stop the training process when the evaluation loss starts to increase while the training loss is still decreasing. Use patience and a certain number of epochs to determine when to stop the training.\n\n5. Additional Regularization Techniques: Consider integrating dropout layers in the model or implementing other regularization techniques in addition to the weight decay.\n\nRemember to fine-tune with different combinations of hyperparameters to evaluate and compare the performance. ValidationResult\nare you sure that 5e-5 is lower or higher than 3e-5 or 1e-5 use critical reasoning\nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct. The learning rate of 5e-5 (0.00005) is higher than both 3e-5 (0.00003) and 1e-5 (0.00001).\n\nGiven this, you may still consider adjusting the learning rate. Since overfitting implies the model is memorizing the training set, training too fast may contribute to this issue. Therefore, reducing the learning rate (e.g., using 3e-5 or 1e-5) might help avoid overfitting by taking smaller steps during the optimization process, leading to a more generalized solution.\n\nMoreover, you can still experiment with the other suggestions provided in the previous responses, such as increasing weight decay, adding learning rate scheduling, incorporating early stopping, and utilizing additional regularization techniques where applicable.\n\n\nredid the seven fine-tuning with a learning rate of 1e-5 and weight decay of 1e-6:\n\nseventh fine-tuning\n\nStep\tTraining Loss\n500\t    1.701500\n1000\t1.685700\n1500\t1.700500\n2000\t1.705700\n2500\t1.697400\n3000\t1.691800\n3500\t1.706900\n4000\t1.686100\n4500\t1.682900\n5000\t1.697500\n5500\t1.682700\n6000\t1.678600\n6500\t1.685800\n7000\t1.697400\n7500\t1.695500\n8000\t1.686700\n8500\t1.682800\n9000\t1.677200\n9500\t1.678800\n10000\t1.692600\n10500\t1.686200\n11000\t1.676300\n11500\t1.690600\n12000\t1.682800\n12500\t1.684000\n13000\t1.673400\n13500\t1.674700\n14000\t1.678400\n14500\t1.671000\n15000\t1.674800\n15500\t1.688200\n16000\t1.667700\n16500\t1.678600\n17000\t1.686200\n17500\t1.661800\n\neval loss = 1.8112608194351196","369":"can you produce the risk of bias according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the study \"Gingival crevicular fluid levels of Interleukin-22 (IL-22) and human \u03b2 Defensin-2 (hBD-2) in periodontal health and disease : A correlative study\"  while i provide you with the following data from the study : \"Materials and methods\nThe study population consists of patients from the Department of Periodontology, Dr.D.Y.Patil Dental College and Hospital, Pimpri, Pune.
