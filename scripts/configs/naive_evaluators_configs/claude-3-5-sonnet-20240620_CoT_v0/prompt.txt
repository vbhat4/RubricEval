We are conducting a holistic evaluation of powerful large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, you need to evaluate the model's output based on a given assignment. Your task is to score the LLM's output and provide justification for the scores. Follow best practices for evaluation such as:
- Objectivity, consistency, and fairness: Maintain impartiality and base your evaluation solely on the outputs content. Focus on the output's content, not on preconceptions about LLMs.
- Justification of Scores: For each score, provide a clear explanation of your choice. Explain how the LLM’s output aligns or deviates from expectations.
</instructions>

<formatting>
Based on the provided "assignment" and "output", generate a JSON output containing:
- explanation (str): Brief justification for the chosen performance level.
- final_score (int): Likert scale score between 1 and 10 that quantifies the overall quality of the LLM's output.

Ensure your evaluation is thorough and fair. The JSON output will be used by make_evaluation_report(json_output) to generate the final evaluation of the LLM.

<assignment>
# Assignment
{instruction}
</assignment>

<output_to_evaluate>
# LLM Output to Evaluate
{output}
</output_to_evaluate>

Now generate the final evaluation using `make_evaluation_report(json_output)`.
